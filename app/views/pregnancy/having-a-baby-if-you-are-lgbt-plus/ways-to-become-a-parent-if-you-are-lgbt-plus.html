                        <p>There are several ways you can become a parent if getting pregnant by having sex is not an option for you.</p>
                        <p>Possible ways to become a parent include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>donor insemination</li>
                            <li>IUI (intrauterine insemination)</li>
                            <li>surrogacy</li>
                            <li>adoption or fostering</li>
                            <li>co-parenting</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are also several ways that could help people with fertility problems have a baby, including <a href="">IVF (in vitro fertilisation)</a>.</p>
                        <p>IUI and IVF can sometimes be done on the NHS. This depends on things like your age. Check with a GP or <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/other-services/Clinical-Commissioning-Group/LocationSearch/1">local integrated care board (ICB)</a> to find out about what might be available to you.</p>
                        <p>Surrogacy is not available on the NHS.</p>
                        <p>All these options can be explored by anyone, including single people and same sex couples.</p>

                      <h2>Donor insemination</h2>
                      <p>Sperm is put inside the person getting pregnant. This can be done at home, with sperm from a licensed fertility clinic, a sperm bank or from someone you know.</p>
                      <p>If you choose donor insemination, it’s better to go to a licensed fertility clinic where the sperm is checked for infections and some inherited conditions. Fertility clinics can also offer support and legal advice.</p>
                      <p>If the sperm is not from a licensed fertility clinic, the person donating the sperm can get tested for sexually transmitted infections at a sexual health clinic.</p>
                      <p>In the UK, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) makes sure licensed fertility clinics run safely and legally.</p>

                        <h2>IUI (intrauterine insemination)</h2>
                        <p>In <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/artificial-insemination/">IUI (intrauterine insemination)</a> sperm is put in the womb of the person getting pregnant. This is done at a licensed fertility clinic. The sperm can be from someone you know or from a sperm bank.</p>
                        <p>A licensed fertility clinic will check the sperm for sexually transmitted infections and inherited conditions.</p>

                        <h2>Co-parenting</h2>
                        <p>This is when 2 or more people team up to conceive and parent children together.</p>
                        <p>As a co-parent, you will not have sole custody of the child. It’s advisable to get legal advice at an early stage of your planning.</p>
                        <p>There are many details to think about, such as how you'll split financial costs.</p>

                        <p>You can apply to adopt or foster through a local authority, or an adoption or foster agency. You do not have to live in the local authority you apply to, and you can be single.</p>
                        <p>You’ll have to complete an assessment before adopting or fostering, with the help of a social worker and preparation training.</p>

                        <h2>Surrogacy</h2>
                        <p>Surrogacy is when someone has a baby for people who cannot, or choose not to, get pregnant themselves.</p>
                        <p>In the UK, either sperm or egg can be from a donor, but not both.</p>
                        <p>Surrogacy is legal in the UK but it's illegal to advertise for surrogates, and the surrogate cannot be paid a fee.</p>
