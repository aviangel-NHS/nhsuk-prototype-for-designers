                        <p>If you have taken testosterone in the past then your milk supply may be affected. So you may not be able to chestfeed your baby.</p>
                        <p>If you can chestfeed and you also decide to start taking testosterone again, your milk will have small amounts of testosterone in it.</p>
                        <p>It is unclear what, if any, affect this could have on your baby.</p>
                        <p>It is also important to consider your own wellbeing if you are finding that not taking testosterone is triggering dysphoria.</p>
                        <p>Talk to your midwife or doctor about any concerns you may have.</p>
