It's used either once or twice a day.</p><p data-block-key="7339x">It should be applied after washing to all of the parts of your face affected by acne.</p><p data-block-key="hjxz8">It should be used sparingly, as too much can irritate your skin.</p><p data-block-key="8g86l">It also makes your face more sensitive to sunlight, so avoid too much sun and sources of ultraviolet (UV) light (such as sunbeds), or wear sun cream.</p><p data-block-key="djf7j">Benzoyl peroxide can have a bleaching effect, so avoid getting it on your hair or&nbsp;clothes.</p><p data-block-key="9vv7q">Common side effects of benzoyl peroxide include:</p><ul><li data-block-key="9o7yq">dry and tense skin</li><li data-block-key="k6lbi">a burning, itching or stinging sensation</li><li data-block-key="mhwuz">some redness and peeling of the skin</li></ul><p data-block-key="07uzi">Side effects are usually mild and should pass once the treatment has finished.</p><p data-block-key="kmmht">Most people need a 6-week course of treatment to clear most or all of their acne.</p><p data-block-key="haijg">You may be advised to continue treatment less frequently to prevent acne returning.</p><h3 data-block-key="1e53f">Topical retinoids</h3><p data-block-key="38rbc">Topical retinoids work by&nbsp;removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin (exfoliating),&nbsp;which helps prevent them building up within hair follicles.</p><p data-block-key="u5izx">Tretinoin and adapalene are topical retinoids used to treat acne.
