          <ul>
            <li data-block-key="eelgc">blackheads&nbsp;–&nbsp;small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin;&nbsp;they're not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces colour</li>
            <li data-block-key="ton5t">whiteheads&nbsp;– have a similar appearance to blackheads, but&nbsp;may be firmer and will not empty when squeezed</li>
            <li data-block-key="x558n">papules –&nbsp;small red bumps that may feel tender or sore</li><li data-block-key="z4sie">pustules –&nbsp;similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus</li>
            <li data-block-key="su1l9">nodules –&nbsp;large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be&nbsp;painful</li>
            <li data-block-key="zes4k">cysts –&nbsp;the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they're large pus-filled lumps that look similar to <a href="/conditions/boils/">boils</a>&nbsp;and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent <a href="/conditions/scars/">scarring</a>

        <h2 id="self-care">Things you can try if you have acne</h2>




          
            



        <p data-block-key="gmu1q">These self-help techniques may be useful:</p><ul><li data-block-key="kkq1x">Do not wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse.</li><li data-block-key="zj5ad">Wash the affected area with&nbsp;a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse.</li><li data-block-key="aaonr">Do not try to "clean out" blackheads or squeeze spots.&nbsp;This can make them worse and cause permanent <a href="/conditions/scars/">scarring</a>.</li><li data-block-key="6g5k">Avoid make-up, skincare and suncare products that are oil-based (sometimes labelled “comedogenic”). Use water-based non-comedogenic products, as they’re less likely to block the pores in your skin.</li><li data-block-key="qsspx">Completely remove make-up before going to bed.</li><li data-block-key="jxbv1">If dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free water-based <a href="/conditions/emollients/">emollient</a>.</li><li data-block-key="ezd7i">Regular exercise cannot improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem.&nbsp;Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising as sweat can irritate your acne.</li><li data-block-key="d3ig0">Wash your hair regularly&nbsp;and try to avoid letting&nbsp;your hair fall across your face.</li></ul><p data-block-key="rfuk8">Although acne cannot be cured, it can be controlled with treatment.</p><p data-block-key="x3g7h">If you develop <a href="/conditions/acne/diagnosis/">mild acne</a>, it's a good idea to speak to a pharmacist for advice.</p><p data-block-key="ih8cp">Several creams, lotions and gels&nbsp;for treating spots are available to buy from pharmacies.</p><p data-block-key="b7avs">Products containing a low concentration of benzoyl peroxide may be recommended, but be careful as this can bleach clothing.</p><p data-block-key="bg0t3">If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back,&nbsp;it may need to be treated with&nbsp;<a href="/conditions/antibiotics/">antibiotics</a> or stronger creams that are only&nbsp;available on prescription.</p>

        <h2 data-block-key="rxkfr">When to seek medical advice</h2><p data-block-key="wjfpk">If you have <a href="/conditions/acne/diagnosis/">mild acne</a>, speak to a pharmacist about medicines to treat it.</p><p data-block-key="t8w4t">If these do not control your acne, or it's making you feel very unhappy, see a GP.</p><p data-block-key="4a555">You should see a GP if you have <a href="/conditions/acne/diagnosis/">moderate or severe acne</a> or you develop nodules or cysts, as they need to be treated properly to avoid scarring.&nbsp;</p><p data-block-key="0se9m">Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring.</p><p data-block-key="05u7n">Treatments can take several months to work, so do not expect results overnight. Once they do start to work, the results are usually good.</p>

        <h2 id="causes">Why do I have acne?</h2>




          
            



        <p data-block-key="scui7">Acne is most commonly&nbsp;linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age.</p><p data-block-key="yjxkd">Certain hormones cause&nbsp;the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum).</p><p data-block-key="gvzwn">This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus.</p><p data-block-key="v0bjj">The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores. Cleaning the skin does not help to remove this blockage.</p><h3 data-block-key="wo9tn">Other possible causes</h3><p data-block-key="t1bo8">Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it's likely that you'll also have acne.</p><p data-block-key="405jx">Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women.</p><p data-block-key="3zwxr">There's no evidence that poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne.</p>

        <h2 data-block-key="uygpt">Who's affected?</h2><p data-block-key="cu5pe">Acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 95% of people aged 11&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;are affected by acne to some extent.</p><p data-block-key="68347">Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14&nbsp;to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16&nbsp;to 19.</p><p data-block-key="5113c">Most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older.</p><p data-block-key="u6w8o">Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-20s.</p><p data-block-key="j7oo1">In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About 3% of adults have acne over the age of 35.</p>
