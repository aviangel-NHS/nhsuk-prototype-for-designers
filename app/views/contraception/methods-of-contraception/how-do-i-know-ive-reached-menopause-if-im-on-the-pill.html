                    <p data-block-key="oi4kt">You cannot know for sure  you've reached the menopause when you're on the pill. This is because  hormonal contraception can affect your periods.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="ly8s3">Menopause (when your periods stop permanently and you're no longer fertile)  is usually diagnosed:</p>
                    <ul><li data-block-key="6tqos">if you're over  50 and have not had a period for more than 12 months</li>
                      <li data-block-key="b6jah">if you're under 50 and  have not had a  period for more than 2 years</li>
                    </ul>
                      <p data-block-key="k6v7q">These rules do not apply if you're taking hormonal contraception.</p>
                      <p data-block-key="pkt52">In younger women, there are other reasons (apart from early menopause)  why periods might stop, so discuss this with a healthcare professional if you're worried.</p>

                    <p data-block-key="c7rpd">If you're taking the combined pill, you'll have monthly period-type bleeds for as long as you keep taking the pill.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="fxpo0">If you're taking the progestogen-only pill, your bleeds may be irregular or stop altogether for as long as you keep taking the pill.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="bss3a">The combined pill may also mask or control menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="j2snt">These factors  can make it hard to know when you're no longer ovulating  and  therefore no longer fertile.</p>

                    <p data-block-key="6lfqo">There is no test that can tell for certain whether you're in the menopause and can stop contraception.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="9w39k">There is a blood test to measure levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) that can indicate if a woman is becoming menopausal. But this is not a useful test in women over 45 as FSH levels naturally go up and down at this time.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="xixxv">The FSH test is also not a reliable indicator that ovulation has stopped if a woman is taking the combined pill. It can be a helpful guide for women over 50 who are taking the progestogen-only pill.</p>

                    <h2 data-block-key="4juv0">Stopping contraception</h2>
                    <p data-block-key="dx7g5">All women can stop using contraception at the age of 55 as getting pregnant naturally after this is very rare. For safety reasons, women are advised to stop the combined pill at 50 and change to a progestogen-only pill or other method of contraception.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="ymfiz">It is sensible to use a barrier method of contraception, such as condoms, to avoid getting <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/">sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</a>, even after the menopause.</p>
