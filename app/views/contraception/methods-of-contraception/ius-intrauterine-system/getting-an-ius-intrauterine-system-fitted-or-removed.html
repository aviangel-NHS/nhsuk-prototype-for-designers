                    <h2 data-block-key="ongma">Having an IUS fitted</h2><p data-block-key="2ieoq">You can usually have an IUS (intrauterine system), also called or hormonal coil, fitted at a GP surgery or sexual health service.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="1njb1">An IUS can be fitted any time in your menstrual cycle, as long as you're not pregnant.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="6enb4">If it's fitted in the first 7 days of your cycle (day 1 is the first day of your period), you'll be protected against pregnancy straight away.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="9g6qc">If it's fitted at any other time, use another type of contraception, such as condoms, for 7 days afterwards.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="tj5i">Having an IUS fitted should take about 5 to10 minutes, but allow at least 30 minutes for the appointment.</p>
                    <h3 data-block-key="9eqt7">Before your IUS is fitted</h3>
                    <p data-block-key="bohpa">Before your IUS is fitted you might be offered:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li data-block-key="3m8eu">a test for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</li>
                      <li data-block-key="3eu95">a pregnancy test (an IUS cannot be fitted if you might be pregnant)</li>
                    </ul><p data-block-key="3kt7u">Some people may find having an IUS fitted painful. You may want to take some painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen an hour before.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="eik29">If you're concerned about pain during the fitting, speak to the nurse or doctor. They may be able to offer you extra pain relief.</p>
                    <h3 data-block-key="6f6t5">The procedure</h3>
                    <p data-block-key="fitqp">During the procedure:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li data-block-key="4qu7o">a nurse or doctor will gently put a smooth, tube-shaped tool (a speculum) into your vagina so they can open it, like a <a href="/conditions/cervical-screening/what-happens-at-your-appointment/">cervical screening (a smear test)</a></li>
                      <li data-block-key="a0d5q">they will insert the IUS into your womb through your cervix</li>
                    </ul>
                      <p data-block-key="h9qv">Tell the person fitting your IUS if you feel any pain or discomfort. You can ask them to stop at any time.</p>
                      <h3 data-block-key="8qagh">After an IUS is fitted</h3>
                      <p data-block-key="2q6pf">After you have an IUS fitted you might have some pain or bleeding for a few days.</p>
                      <p data-block-key="9vup8">You may be advised to have a doctor or nurse check your IUS 3 to 6 weeks after having it fitted.</p>
                      <h2 data-block-key="3rqfc">Checking an IUS is still in place</h2>
                      <p data-block-key="57ith">An IUS has 2 thin, soft threads that hang down a little way from your womb into the top of your vagina.</p>
                      <p data-block-key="a6f9r">The doctor or nurse who fits your IUS will teach you how to feel these threads to check it's still in place.</p>
                      <p data-block-key="epoj2">Check your IUS is in place a few times in the first month and then regularly, such as after each period.</p>
                      <p data-block-key="2t264">If you cannot feel the threads the IUS might not be in place, and you should see a doctor or nurse straight away.</p>
                
                
                <div class="nhsuk-warning-callout">
                  <h3 class="nhsuk-warning-callout__label">
                      If you cannot feel your IUS threads
                    
                  </h3>
                    <p data-block-key="swpni">If you cannot feel the threads when you check for them you might not be protected against pregnancy, and you may need <a href="../../emergency-contraception">emergency contraception</a>. 
                      The IUS can make some forms of emergency contraception less effective, so speak to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="jc2j">Use another form of contraception until a doctor or nurse has checked your IUS.</p>
                  </div>
                
       
                    <h2 data-block-key="ongma">Having an IUS removed</h2>
                    <p data-block-key="1qps0">A trained doctor or nurse can remove your IUS at any time.</p>
                    <p data-block-key="dlatt">An IUS is effective for 3 to 5 years, depending on the type. Speak to your doctor to find out when your IUS is due to be removed or replaced. </p>
                    <p data-block-key="8kcm1">It's possible to get pregnant as soon as your IUS has been taken out. </p>
                    <p data-block-key="ea0im">If you do not want to get pregnant, use another type of contraception, such as condoms, starting 7 days before you have it removed.</p>
