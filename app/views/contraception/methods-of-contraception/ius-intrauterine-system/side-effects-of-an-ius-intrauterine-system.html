                    <h2>Side effects of an IUS</h2>
                    <p>Side effects of an IUS (intrauterine system), also called a hormonal coil, are most common for a few months after having it fitted. Many IUS users do not get any side effects.</p>
                    <p>Possible side effects include:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>pain and bleeding for a few days after the procedure</li>
                      <li>small fluid-filled sacs (cysts) on your ovaries â€“ these are usually harmless and disappear without treatment</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some people report headaches, acne, sore breasts, and mood changes. However, there isn't enough evidence to say whether this is caused by an IUS.</p>
                    <p>If you get any of these symptoms, they should go away within a few months. If any side effects are a problem for you, speak to a doctor or nurse.</p>
                    <p>Your partner should not be able to feel your IUS during sex. If they can, see a doctor or nurse for a check-up.</p>
                    <h3>How an IUS affects periods</h3>
                    <p>An IUS can significantly reduce menstrual bleeding, and even stop periods altogether for some users.</p>
                    <p>Some types of IUS are the most effective treatments for heavy periods.</p>
                    <p>However, you might get irregular, longer or more frequent bleeding for 3 to 6 months after having an IUS fitted. But this should improve within a few months.</p>
                    <p>If irregular or heavy bleeding continues for longer than 6 months, see your doctor or nurse for a check-up. </p>
                    
                    <h2>How well does an IUS work</h2>
                    <p>An IUS is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.</p>
                    <p>This means that less than 1 in 100 women using an IUS as their method of contraception get pregnant each year.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Risks of the IUS</h2>
                    <p>The IUS is very safe, but there are some rare risks, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>pelvic infections, usually within 3 weeks of having an IUS fitted</li>
                      <li>your IUS moving or being pushed out by the womb, usually within 3 months of having an IUS fitted</li>
                      <li>damage to the womb</li>
                      <li><a href="/conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/">ectopic pregnancy</a> in the rare case that the IUS fails</li>
                    </ul>
